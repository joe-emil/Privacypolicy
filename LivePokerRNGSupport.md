## Live Poker RNG: Support  

You can select a timespan from the visible slider. After pressing start, the app will play a random number from 1-100 and say it out loud after the given timespan.
For example, you chose 30 from the slider, now the app will say a random number every 30 seconds until you press stop.
There's also a notes page where you can write your notes.
